# Recochoku Patch

Reochoku requires NEX game server authentication in order to work. This patch forcefully makes the title think authentication succeeded so the app can be used normally.

The patch requires Recochoku (0004000000099700) with version v20656 to function.

To use the patch, enable Luma3DS game patching and place the `code.ips` file at `sd:/luma/titles/0004000000099700/code.ips`.

Once installed, the patch should work out of the box.
