# Kiradeco Revolution

A patch for the DLC menu in Kiradeco Revolution (0004000000068300) (JP) to skip loading the eShop applet. This allows you to go straight into the DLC management menu without having an internet connection / a console with the correct region, to enable DLC management after the DLC is no longer on sale.

How to use:

- Enable Luma3DS game patching.
- Copy [code.ips](./code.ips) to `sd:/luma/titles/0004000000068300/code.ips`.
- Have the DLC installed (0004008C00068300).
- Launch the game and enter the DLC section.
- You should now be able to install/uninstall decorations without having to go through the eShop applet.
